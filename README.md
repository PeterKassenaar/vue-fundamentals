# vue-fundamentals
example code on the training Vue Fundamentals.

## Usage
- This repository is an addendum to the course Vue Fundamentals by internationally acclaimed trainer Peter Kassenaar.
- Code examples are in the `examples` folder.
- Every example is a mini project. This means you have to run `npm install` and `npm run serve` in every folder (b/c we choose this *not* to be a monorepo).
- Projects are created with `@vue/cli@3.2.1` and are using Vue version `2.5.17`, unless otherwise noted.
