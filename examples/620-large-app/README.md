# large-vue-app
This is *not* a working app. It is an example of a proposed module 
and folder structure for larger, enterprise-like apps.

Look at the `src` folder for a the layout of modules and contents of modules.

- There is always only one `core` folder.
- There is one `router` folder
- There is a barrel `store` folder, aggegrating the different store modules.
